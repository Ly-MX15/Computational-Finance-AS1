This report presents a comprehensive analysis of option valuation methods, focusing on the
binomial tree model and the Black-Scholes model for European and American options. It delves
into theoretical aspects of financial derivatives and the no-arbitrage principle, offering a detailed
examination of various compounding types and their implications on option pricing. Through
mathematical derivations and practical simulations, the report compares the binomial tree and
Black-Scholes models in terms of option price approximation, computational efficiency, and the
calculation of hedge parameters, also evaluates the effectiveness of dynamic hedging strategies
